Setup with @BeforeEach
Purpose:
Initializes the MockMvc and ObjectMapper before each test.

Logic:

mockMvc is configured to test the billerController.
objectMapper is prepared for JSON processing if needed.
Test Case: shouldTest_GetBillerCategories
Purpose:
Tests that the /biller/categories endpoint returns a 200 OK status and calls the service method with the correct parameter.

Logic:

Perform Request:

Simulates a GET request to /services/biller-data/v1/biller/categories.
Adds a query parameter billerCategoryVersion set to "1".
Sets the expected response type to JSON.
Assertions:

andExpect(MockMvcResultMatchers.status().isOk())
Asserts that the response status is 200 OK.
(The JSON path check is commented out, which would verify the category name in the response.)
Verification:

verify(billerService).getBillerCategories(1);
Ensures that getBillerCategories is called with the parameter 1.
Key Points:

This test confirms the endpoint correctly interacts with the service layer and handles requests as expected.
Using MockMvc allows for testing the web layer without deploying the application.
