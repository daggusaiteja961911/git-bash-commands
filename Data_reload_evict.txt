Test Case 1: shouldGetBillerDataUpdateInfo
Purpose:
Ensures that the getBillerDataUpdateInfo method returns the expected response with update information.

Logic:

Data Setup:

Creates a BillerDataUpdateInfoRequest.
Constructs a BillerDataUpdateInfoResponse with update timestamps and an empty list for plan details.
Mock Setup:

when(billerService.getBillerDataUpdateInfo(request)).thenReturn(response);
Configures the mock service to return the prepared response when the method is called.
Controller Call:

Calls the getBillerDataUpdateInfo method on billerController with the request.
Assertion:

assertEquals(response, result);
Verifies that the response matches the expected output.
Test Case 2: shouldGetReloadCacheForBillerData
Purpose:
Tests that the reloadCacheForBillerData method reloads the cache and returns the expected result.

Logic:

Data Setup:

Creates a BillerDataCacheReloadRequest.
Builds a BillerDataCacheAlterResponse with IDs to retry.
Mock Setup:

when(billerService.reloadCacheForBillerData(any(BillerDataCacheReloadRequest.class))).thenReturn(response);
Sets the mock service to return the response for any cache reload request.
Controller Call:

Calls reloadCacheForBillerData on the controller with the request.
Assertions:

assertEquals(response, result);
Confirms that the response is as expected.
verify(billerService, times(1)).reloadCacheForBillerData(any(BillerDataCacheReloadRequest.class));
Checks that the service method was called exactly once.
Test Case 3: shouldGetEvictCacheForBillerData
Purpose:
Validates that the evictCacheForBillerData method correctly evicts cache and provides the expected response.

Logic:

Data Setup:

Creates a BillerDataCacheEvictRequest.
Constructs a BillerDataCacheAlterResponse with IDs to retry.
Mock Setup:

when(billerService.evictCacheForBillerData(any(BillerDataCacheEvictRequest.class))).thenReturn(response);
Mocks the service to return the response for any cache eviction request.
Controller Call:

Calls evictCacheForBillerData on the controller with the request.
Assertion:

assertEquals(response, result);
Ensures the response matches the expected result.
(The verify line is commented out, which means itâ€™s not currently checking the number of invocations.)
Why Use when(...).thenReturn(...):

Simulates the service layer behavior, allowing the controller logic to be tested independently without actual service calls.
