Annotations
@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class): This annotation is used to enable Mockito in JUnit 5 tests. It initializes mocks and other Mockito-related components.
@Mock: Creates a mock instance of the specified class (BillerService). This allows you to simulate behavior for testing without calling the actual methods.
@Spy: Creates a spy instance, which is a real object with some methods stubbed. Used here on BillerControllerImpl.
@InjectMocks: Injects mock or spy fields into the tested object, billerController, for testing.
@Autowired: Automatically injects the MockMvc instance, which is used for testing MVC controllers.


Tests
shouldGetBillerCategories:

Logic: Mocks the getBillerCategories method to return a predefined response.
Purpose: Ensures the controller's method getBillerCategories returns a non-null response.
shouldGetBillerCategories_WithData:

Logic: Sets up a mock response with specific data and asserts the returned data matches expectations.
Purpose: Validates that the controller correctly handles and returns populated data.
shouldGetPopularBillers:

Logic: Uses MockMvc to perform a GET request and expects a 200 OK status.
Purpose: Tests the controller's endpoint for getting popular billers, ensuring it responds correctly.
shouldGetPopularBillers_WithData:

Logic: Mocks a response with data and uses MockMvc to check the response structure and content.
Purpose: Confirms that the endpoint returns the expected data format and values.
shouldGetBillerById:

Logic: Mocks the getBillerById method and performs a GET request.
Purpose: Tests the endpoint for retrieving a biller by ID, ensuring it returns a 200 OK status.
shouldGetBillerDataUpdateInfo:

Logic: Mocks the getBillerDataUpdateInfo method and asserts the response.
Purpose: Verifies that the controller returns the correct update information for biller data.
shouldGetReloadCacheForBillerData:

Logic: Mocks a cache reload request and verifies method invocation.
Purpose: Ensures the cache reload functionality behaves as expected.
shouldGetEvictCacheForBillerData:

Logic: Mocks a cache eviction request and checks the response.
Purpose: Validates the cache eviction logic.
shouldGetBillerIncorrectSearchKeywords:

Logic: Mocks the getBillerIncorrectSearchKeywords method and performs a GET request.
Purpose: Confirms the response contains the expected incorrect search keywords and timestamp.
shouldGetBillerIncorrectSearchKeywords_WithData:

Logic: Sets up data for incorrect keywords and verifies the JSON response structure.
Purpose: Ensures the API correctly formats and returns data for incorrect keywords.
MockMvc
Used for simulating HTTP requests and validating responses without running a full server.
This setup is typical for testing controller logic, ensuring endpoints return correct data and statuses.
