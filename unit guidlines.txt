Your guidelines for writing unit tests are quite comprehensive. However, there are a few points that could be clarified or expanded upon to ensure best practices are followed. Here are some suggestions and updates:

1. **Version Updates**:
   - Mockito version 1.9.5 is quite outdated. The latest stable version as of now is 4.x. Consider updating to the latest version for better features and support.

2. **General Guidelines**:
   - **Test Naming Conventions**: Ensure that test method names are descriptive and follow a consistent naming convention. This helps in understanding the purpose of the test at a glance.
   - **Test Independence**: Each unit test should be independent of others. Tests should not rely on the order of execution or shared state.

3. **Detailed Guidelines**:
   - **Small Piece of Code**: Clarify what constitutes a "small piece of testable code". Typically, this means a single method or a small group of related methods.
   - **Safety Net**: Emphasize the importance of regression testing. Unit tests should catch regressions when changes are made to the codebase.
   - **Single Responsibility**: Each test should have a single responsibility and test one aspect of the code.
   - **Positive and Negative Flows**: Ensure that edge cases and boundary conditions are also covered in the tests.
   - **Mocking**: Provide examples of how to mock dependencies correctly. Mention the use of `@Mock` and `@InjectMocks` annotations in Mockito.
   - **Assertions**: Use appropriate assertion libraries like AssertJ for more readable and expressive assertions.
   - **Bottom-Up Approach**: Clarify that private methods should be tested indirectly through public methods. Avoid changing method visibility just for testing purposes.

4. **Additional Points**:
   - **Code Coverage**: Aim for high code coverage but do not compromise on the quality of tests. Coverage tools like JaCoCo can be used to measure this.
   - **Test Performance**: Ensure that unit tests run quickly. Avoid long-running tests in the unit test suite.
   - **Continuous Integration**: Integrate unit tests into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure tests are run automatically on each commit.
   - **Documentation**: Document the purpose of each test class and method, especially if the logic is complex.

# Unit Tests Writing Guidelines

## Versions
- JUnit 5 version: 5.9.1
- Mockito version: 4.x (latest stable version)

## Guidelines
1. **Small Piece of Code**: A unit test should test only a small piece of testable code, typically a single method or a small group of related methods.
2. **Safety Net**: Unit tests should be written to ensure our code has a safety net. If some change is introduced in the future, corresponding unit tests should fail to catch regressions.
3. **Single Responsibility**: One unit test should be testing only one scenario or condition in the flow.
4. **Positive and Negative Flows**: Both positive and negative flows and scenarios should be covered by unit tests. Ensure edge cases and boundary conditions are also tested.
5. **Mocking**: While mocking external calls (DB, external service, Cache, etc.), we should mock only the immediate calls and not the cascaded ones. For example, if a method `mt` has a dependency on `e1`, and `e1` has a dependency on `c1`, while writing a unit test for `mt`, we should only be mocking the call to `e1` and not `c1`.
6. **Assertions**: Assertions used in unit tests should be exhaustive and should validate the necessary business logic implemented. Consider using libraries like AssertJ for more expressive assertions.
7. **Bottom-Up Approach**: Unit tests follow a bottom-up approach. We should be testing small individual methods. Private methods should be tested indirectly through public methods.
8. **Test Naming Conventions**: Ensure that test method names are descriptive and follow a consistent naming convention.
9. **Test Independence**: Each unit test should be independent of others. Tests should not rely on the order of execution or shared state.
10. **Code Coverage**: Aim for high code coverage but do not compromise on the quality of tests. Use tools like JaCoCo to measure coverage.
11. **Test Performance**: Ensure that unit tests run quickly. Avoid long-running tests in the unit test suite.
12. **Continuous Integration**: Integrate unit tests into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure tests are run automatically on each commit.
13. **Documentation**: Document the purpose of each test class and method, especially if the logic is complex.

These additions and clarifications should help in maintaining a robust and effective unit testing strategy.
